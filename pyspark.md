# PySpark

## Challenge
Process and analyze a dataset using PySpark.

## Dataset
Use the "NYC Taxi Trip Duration" dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data

## Requirements

1. **Data Ingestion:**
- Read the dataset (train.csv) into a PySpark DataFrame.
- Handle any necessary data cleaning or preprocessing steps.

2. **Data Exploration:**
- Compute summary statistics for relevant columns (e.g., trip duration, distance).
- Visualize key insights using PySpark's built-in plotting capabilities or other plotting libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
- Create additional features that may be useful for analysis (e.g., time of day, day of week).
- Perform any necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.

4. **Documentation:**
- Provide comments throughout the code to explain key steps and reasoning.
- Summarize insights gained from the analysis.

**Timeframe**: between 1 to 2 hours.

**Submission**: after finishing, upload your project source code to a public GitHub repository. Provide clear instructions for executing your scripts and include screenshots showcasing the results.
