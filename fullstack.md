# Full Stack

## Challenge
Develop a simple full-stack web application for displaying a library's book inventory.

## Requirements

### Backend (Node.js)

1. **API Creation**
- Set up a Node.js server using Express.
- Create a RESTful API endpoint for retrieving books.
- Each book should have the following attributes:
    - Title
    - Author
    - ISBN
    - Genre
    - Publication Year
    - Number of Copies Available

2. **Database Integration**
- Use a lightweight database like SQLite or MongoDB for storing book data.
- Implement a data model for books and integrate it with the Express server using an ORM (e.g., Sequelize for SQL databases, Mongoose for MongoDB).

## Frontend (React)

3. **User Interface:**
- Create a simple user interface using React for displaying a list of books from the library.
- Include components for listing books with their details.

4. **API Integration:**
- Connect the React frontend to the Node.js backend by making an HTTP request to retrieve books from the API endpoint.

5. **User Experience:**
- Ensure a seamless user experience by displaying book details neatly and clearly in the frontend.
- Implement basic error handling for failed API requests.

___

**Timeframe:** between 1 to 2 hours to complete.

**Submission:** once completed, push your project source code to a public GitHub repository. Document instructions for building and running the application and take screenshots showcasing your app running.
