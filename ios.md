# iOS

## Challenge
Create a simple iOS app that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a list.

## Requirements
1. Use the JSONPlaceholder API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
2. Fetch data from the API using URLSession or Alamofire
3. Display the fetched data in a UITableView or UICollectionView
4. Each item in the list should display at least two pieces of information from the API response (e.g., title and body for posts)
5. When an item in the list is clicked, display a detail view with more information about the selected item
6. Perform network operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the main UI thread and maintain a smooth user experience
